In order to fully defend their flags, they must acquire the pieces scattered around the map to build the equipment or even a wall and for upgrade as well. Teammates must deploy the beacon near their base in order for them to view if there are enemies nearby. 1 player should be on the base to have a larger view of the even outside the camp but just a couple of meters only. The player also that was defending the base can have the items that his teammates get and create the equipment or walls. Every game has random maps and items but will always be fair to both sides.

*Features:*
**Skills** - Players can have skills that can be used by themselves or for their teammates based on what they picked before the game started so they'll have to plan with each other.

**Ranks** - Players will not have levels to make their health or defense go higher but instead only their experience that they can rely on and the only way to show their skills is on their ranks and their standings per ranks.
